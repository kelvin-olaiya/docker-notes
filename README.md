# Docker

## From  the 2021/22 course edition

In this repository you'll find my notes on **docker** derived from the "Virtualizzazione ed Integrazione di sistemi" 2021/22 course edition.
It may certainly contain some errors. So please, if you spot any of those feel free to open a PR.

I hope it will be usefull.
Happy reading!
